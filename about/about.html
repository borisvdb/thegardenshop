				Our Story
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="paragraph" align="justify">
					Based in Portarlington, Co. Laois, TheGardenShop.ie was founded in 2011 with the principle of offering a wide range of garden products for the best value in Ireland. Together with our low-cost model & strong focus on customer service, our online garden shop quickly expanded in the Irish market.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph" align="justify">
					At TheGardenShop.ie, we have something for everyone, whether you are a beginner who wants to start out with a few small pots and trays on your windowsill, the 'green fingered' expert or professional landscape gardener, we have the tools for you. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph" align="justify">
					TheGardenShop.ie was set up with the aim of filling a massive gap in the garden supplies & tools market. To date, there are no other discount online garden centres where the public can go and get all their gardening equipment at massively discounted prices. There has been, to date a sort of unwritten rule on pricing and this is what TheGardenShop.ie aims to break. By this, we hope to give the whole gardening market in Ireland a huge & badly needed shake up. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph" align="justify">
					We currently stock over 2500 different products and our committed team are constantly searching out new top quality tools, unique plants and handy garden equipment to offer to our customers at great low prices. We stock top quality gardening brands including Felco, Spears & Jackson, Wolf Garden, Wilkinson Sword, Oleo Mac and many more. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph" align="justify">
					In 2016 we redeveloped our website to offer our customers a more complete online shopping experience & we work tirelessly behind the scenes to maintain our high standards of customer service, shipping & quality of products. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph" align="justify">
					In May, 2021 we opened new eco garden shop & food village in Portarlington. SOLAS eco garden shop offers a wide range of environmentally friendly products as well as all your favourite garden plants, seeds, tools, landscaping equipment, gardening accessories, garden plants, furniture & so much more. 
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph" align="justify">
					If you have any questions about us, our products or need help with your garden please get in touch with us via our contact us page. There is always someone on hand to take your questions and experts to offer you gardening advice. We also have an ever growing online catalogue of ‘How to Garden’ articles, advice & videos. See more in our How To Garden section.
